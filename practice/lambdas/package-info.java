/*
Learning lambdas, FI, imperative vs declarative programming.
1. Before java 8 we could not pass functions/behavior or implementation to a method. We were only able to pass
variables. But with lambdas / anonymous functions  we can do that. We can now pass behaviours as args to methods
2. FI and lambdas are the building blocks of Func. programming.
3. After java 8, functions are treated as variables.
   We can assign functions as variables with the help of FI
4. Lambdas are code blocks which will be executed when needed. Anonymous inner class (traditional approach)
 compiles to a class, does all the linking statically when the code is compiled.
 While lambda is an invoke dynamic instruction which allows dynamic language to bind symbols at run time.
 Therefore lambdas are lightweight and do not create unnecessary classes.
5. Imperative- HOW TO
6. Declarative - WHAT TO
